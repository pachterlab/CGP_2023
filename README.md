# meK-Means: Biophysically Interpretable Inference of Cell Types from Multimodal Sequencing Data

Notebooks for reproducing all figures and analysis of simulated and single-cell datasets for the meK-Means paper.

## Getting Started

The [`meKMeans_example_notebook.ipynb`](https://github.com/tarachari3/CGP_2023/blob/main/meKMeans_example_notebook.ipynb) is an example notebook to demonstrate download and usage of meK-Means.

It can be run from Google Colab, with the Colab link included at the top of the notebook. Just click on the [![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com) symbol.

An introduction to using Google Colab can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com). Briefly, run each code cell by selecting the cell and executing Command/Ctrl+Enter. Code cells can be edited by simply clicking on the cell to start typing.

```
#To install meK-Means

git clone https://github.com/pachterlab/monod.git
cd ./monod
git checkout meKMeans
pip install -q ./
pip install -q -r ./monod/src/monod.egg-info/requires.txt
```

All saved/processed data used for analysis can be found on [CaltechData](https://data.caltech.edu/search?q=meK-Means%20AND%20tara%20chari&f=resource_type%3Adataset&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=bestmatch).
